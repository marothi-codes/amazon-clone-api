# Amazon Clone 2.0 API backend

> The Node.js express server backend for the Amazon Clone 2.0, this serves as the Firebase replace used in version 1.0 with the objective of flexing my full-stack biceps at the onlookers. Hopefully I smash the project and build a banger haha...

## Tools used

- Node.js
- express.js
- mongodb
- mongoose
- Visual Studio Code

## Gameplan

The gameplan is to build a basic **Amazon-like** online store and gradually add substantial features and improvements as time goes.

The objective is to make this the eCommerce bread and buttuer of my **MERNG** stack portfolio.
